# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#
# board: [ "nrfmicro_13" ]
# shield: [ "noir65_left", "noir65_right" ]
# include:
#   - board: nrfmicro_13
#     shield: noir65_left
#   - board: nrfmicro_13
#     shield: noir65_right
#     cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_USB_LOGGING=y
#     artifact-name: noir65_left_with_logging
